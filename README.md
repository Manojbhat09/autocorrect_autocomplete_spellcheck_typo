# GPT-2 Autocorrect System

A sophisticated autocorrect system that combines NLTK vocabulary matching with GPT-2 context scoring for accurate spell correction. This system leverages the power of language models to provide context-aware corrections that go beyond simple dictionary matching.

## Features

### 🧠 **Intelligent Context-Aware Correction**
- Uses GPT-2 language model to understand context and provide meaningful corrections
- Combines traditional vocabulary matching with neural language model scoring
- Considers surrounding words to make better correction decisions

### 🔍 **Multi-Source Candidate Generation**
- **NLTK Vocabulary Matching**: Uses difflib for fuzzy string matching against English dictionary
- **GPT-2 Suggestions**: Generates contextual word suggestions using language model completion
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both methods for comprehensive candidate coverage

### 📊 **Advanced Scoring System**
- Scores each candidate using GPT-2 perplexity (negative log-likelihood)
- Context-aware scoring that considers word relationships
- Robust error handling for edge cases and invalid scores

### 🛠️ **Robust Error Handling**
- Graceful fallback when GPT-2 suggestions fail
- NaN and infinite value detection and handling
- Comprehensive error reporting and debugging information

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for better performance)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually:
```bash
pip install torch>=1.9.0 transformers>=4.20.0 nltk>=3.7
```

### Download NLTK Data
The system will automatically download required NLTK data on first run. If automatic download fails, you can manually download:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('words')
nltk.download('gutenberg')
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from gpt2_autocorrect import GPT2Autocorrect

# Initialize the autocorrect system
autocorrect = GPT2Autocorrect()

# Correct a single word
corrected_word = autocorrect.autocorrect_word("recieve")
print(corrected_word)  # Output: "receive"

# Correct a sentence
corrected_sentence = autocorrect.autocorrect_sentence("I recieve the package yesterday")
print(corrected_sentence)  # Output: "I receive the package yesterday"

# Correct multiple sentences
corrected_text = autocorrect.autocorrect_text("The accomodation was very nice. I beleive it was definately worth it.")
print(corrected_text)  # Output: "The accommodation was very nice. I believe it was definitely worth it."
```

### Interactive Mode

Run the script directly for an interactive autocorrect session:

```bash
python gpt2_autocorrect.py
```

### Advanced Usage with Scoring Details

```python
# Get detailed scoring information
word = "recieve"
context = ["I", "will"]
corrected, scores = autocorrect.autocorrect_word_with_scores(word, context)

print(f"Original: {word}")
print(f"Corrected: {corrected}")
print("All candidate scores:")
for candidate, score in scores.items():
    print(f"  {candidate}: {score:.3f}")
```

## How It Works

### 1. **Candidate Generation**
The system generates correction candidates through two methods:

- **Vocabulary Matching**: Uses `difflib.get_close_matches()` to find similar words from NLTK's English vocabulary
- **GPT-2 Suggestions**: Generates contextual completions using the language model

### 2. **Context-Aware Scoring**
Each candidate is scored using GPT-2's perplexity calculation:

```python
def score_text(self, text: str) -> float:
    input_ids = self.tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors='pt')
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = self.model(input_ids, labels=input_ids)
    return -outputs.loss.item()  # Higher is better
```

### 3. **Best Candidate Selection**
The candidate with the highest score (lowest perplexity) is selected as the correction.

## Technical Details

### Model Configuration
- **Base Model**: GPT-2 (default)
- **Tokenizer**: GPT2Tokenizer with left padding
- **Vocabulary**: NLTK words corpus (235,892 words) with fallback dictionary

### Performance Considerations
- **GPU Acceleration**: Automatically uses CUDA if available
- **Memory Usage**: ~500MB for GPT-2 model
- **Speed**: ~100-500ms per word depending on hardware

### Error Handling
- **Invalid Scores**: Detects and handles NaN/infinite values
- **Empty Input**: Gracefully handles empty or whitespace-only input
- **Model Errors**: Comprehensive exception handling with fallback mechanisms

## Examples

### Common Misspellings

| Original | Corrected | Context |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `recieve` | `receive` | "I will recieve the package" |
| `accomodation` | `accommodation` | "The accomodation was nice" |
| `beleive` | `believe` | "I beleive in you" |
| `definately` | `definitely` | "That's definately correct" |
| `seperate` | `separate` | "Please seperate the items" |

### Context-Aware Corrections

The system considers context to make better decisions:

```python
# Without context
autocorrect.autocorrect_word("read")  # Might suggest "read" (already correct)

# With context
autocorrect.autocorrect_word("read", ["I", "will"])  # Might suggest "read" or "ready"
```

## Configuration

### Custom Model
You can use different GPT-2 variants:

```python
# Use GPT-2 Medium
autocorrect = GPT2Autocorrect(model_name="gpt2-medium")

# Use GPT-2 Large
autocorrect = GPT2Autocorrect(model_name="gpt2-large")
```

### Adjusting Parameters

```python
# Increase number of candidates
candidates = autocorrect.get_candidates("word", max_candidates=10)

# Adjust GPT-2 suggestion parameters
suggestions = autocorrect.get_gpt2_suggestions("word", max_suggestions=5)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CUDA Out of Memory**
   - Reduce batch size or use CPU: `torch.set_default_tensor_type('torch.FloatTensor')`

2. **NLTK Download Errors**
   - Manually download: `nltk.download('words')`
   - Check internet connection

3. **NaN Scores**
   - The system handles this automatically with fallback values
   - Check input text for special characters or very short inputs

4. **Nouns**
